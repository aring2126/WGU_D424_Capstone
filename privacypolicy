## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not share your data with anyone** because:
- All data remains on your device
- We have no access to your data
- No third-party services are integrated
- No analytics or tracking services are used

The only exception is when you explicitly choose to share a report using Android's share functionality, which is entirely under your control.

## Children's Privacy

Goal Tracker does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The app is designed for general use and does not target children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to the app, you can delete it by uninstalling the application.

## Data Retention

Your data is retained on your device until:
- You manually delete specific goals or tasks
